This application has been made as part of the "Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" by Dr.Angela Yu.

Section 13: Networking and API Challenge

The objective of this challenge was to apply usage of URLSession to make HTTP requests and JSONDecoder for JSON parsing.
The app should display the rate of 1 Bitcoin against a regular currency.

I went a bith further and added/changed few things:

- added another component to the UIPickerView to choose between multiple crypto currency ( not Bitcoin only 
- changed the design

What's feature left to add :

- Fetch crypto currency and regular currency list from the API to fill the currency 2d Array.
- Reverse rate functionnality: 1 Bitcoin = x Euros -> 1 euros = x Bictoin
